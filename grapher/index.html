        <p>this grapher is really bad. the range for now is from -10 to 10 on both axis, you can change it in the javascript code if
            you'd like. it also uses mathjs to parse expressions, so thanks a lot to them. you have to specify multiplication to it,
            since it doenst understand implicit multiplication (like 2x+1 or 4(10+5)).

            example: 5*x + 1
                     ((42)/(55x)) - ((43x/123))
        </p>

        <p>it uses lines to approximate the result. change the "lines" variable at the top of the javascript code to increase it. this
            also means that sometimes lines just might not appear or might behave unexpectedly. try 1/x if you want to see it.
