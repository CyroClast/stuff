        for when i finish this..
        do you think i should start a blog?
        i like writing about what i think, but making a diary is too personal.
        but i wonder if people even read blogs. and if they do, would they even find mine interesting?
        i just play undertale and some other games i like.
        i'll probrably just write about stuff im doing. i like rambling.
